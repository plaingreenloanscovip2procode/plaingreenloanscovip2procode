Repayment terms can range from a several months to a several years. The interest rate, which is typically a fixed rate, depends on your credit score and history, your income, your existing debt, the loan term and amount, and current interest rates.

In general, if you have a strong credit history with a good credit score and a low amount of debt, you could qualify for a lower interest rate than borrowers with poor credit score and a higher level of debt. Every lender has its own minimum credit score requirement, so it's worth finding that out before you apply. 

Applying for an installment loan will temporarily ding your credit score because the lender will run a hard inquiry on your credit. But if you make your loan payments on time each month, your score should recover quickly and even improve thanks to a history of on-time payments.
